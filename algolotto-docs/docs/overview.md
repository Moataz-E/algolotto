# Overview

Algolotto is an operator of games of chance built on the [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/) blockchain. The principal game is a simple weekly lottery game.

## Weekly Lottery

Throughout the week, money collected from the purchased tickets will be placed in a prize pot. Once the weekly designated draw block has been reached, a random draw will take place amongst wallets which have purchased tickets and the prize money will immediately be sent to the winner. 

Chance of winning is higher for wallets with more tickets.

Once the prize has been dispensed, a new round will commence and partipants will be directed to purchase tickets for that round.
